# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) #

Is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

## The data set we are going to use ##

We are going to use the (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris "Iris") data set which is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

### What do the instances in this dataset represent? ###

Each instance is a plant.

### What is the idea of the project? ###

This is a flower classification project using KNN in C, where we want to learn about ML using supervised learning.

### The process ###

We have divided the data into features like (length and width of sepal and petal) and labels (flower species). We have then normalized the data so that they are on the same scale.
